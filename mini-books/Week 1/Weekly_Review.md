# Weekly Review - Week 1

## What I learned this week:

*   **Linux:** I'm getting comfortable with basic navigation and file manipulation in the terminal. I've also learned how to manage permissions, which is a big step. The `chmod` and `chown` commands are powerful.
*   **Python:** I've covered the fundamentals of Python, including variables, data types, and control flow. I'm excited to start building more complex scripts.

## Challenges:

*   **Linux:** Remembering all the command-line options is tricky. I need to use `man` more often.
*   **Python:** I'm still getting used to the syntax, especially for loops and dictionaries.

## Plan for Next Week:

*   I will focus on practicing the commands and concepts I've learned this week.
*   I'm looking forward to diving into functions and OOP in Python.
*   I want to start using `grep` and `find` more effectively in Linux.
