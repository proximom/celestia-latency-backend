# Final Review - Week 2

## What did I understand well?

*   **Linux:** I feel much more confident working with processes and services. Creating a systemd service was a great learning experience. I also have a better understanding of how to monitor system resources.
*   **Python:** I'm starting to get the hang of object-oriented programming. I can see how classes and objects will be useful for organizing my code. I also enjoyed building the CLI tools.

## What must I revisit later?

*   **Linux:** I need more practice with `journalctl` and its advanced filtering options. I also want to explore `systemd` in more depth.
*   **Python:** I need to work on more complex OOP examples to solidify my understanding. I also want to learn more about packaging and distributing Python applications.

## Next Month Learning Goals

*   **Linux:**
    *   Learn how to write more complex shell scripts.
    *   Explore containerization with Docker.
    *   Learn the basics of a configuration management tool like Ansible.
*   **Python:**
    *   Build a small web application with Flask or Django.
    *   Learn how to write unit tests for my Python code.
    *   Explore data analysis libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
